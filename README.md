# Precipitation-Intensity-Index
This script calculates a simple normalized index for evaluating the intensity of daily precipitation in a given basin on a monthly scale (also called peakedness of the monthly precipitation). The precipitation data is a .nc file, and a .shp file for calculating the index at basin scale can be given.
